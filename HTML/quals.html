            <p> In 2019, I experienced being a part of our school's English TV Broadcasting team. 
                It's somewhat of a complex experience for me because I had different roles on
                different competitions. I was an Anchor for our entry in Division Schools Press Conference (DSPC), on
                which we won 1st Place. Heading on to Regional Schools Press Conference (RSPC), I became Video/Graphics
                Editor because our original one has backed out. In the end, we did not qualify for Nationals but I did
                have a great time.

        <h2> PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER </h2>
            <center> <img src="ssgpic.jpg" height="300px"> </center> <br>
            
            <p> In 2020, I became a Public Information Officer for our school's SSG. I showed my leadership skills
                within the term I was given, and I provided quality information and design as a PIO. I have also
                shown my skills in photo and video editing, to which I can say I was overqualified for the position.
